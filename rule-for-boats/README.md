# Rules for Boats

## Directions on a Ship

* **Bow:** The bow of a ship is the part of the ship that faces forward when the ship underway. The bow is usually distinguished by a sharply angled hull, which provides less resistance, making it easier for the ship to plow through water.

* **Stern:** The stern is located at the back end of the ship, opposite from the bow.

* **Forward** Forward on a ship means toward the direction of the bow.

* **Aft** Aft on a ship means toward the direction of the stern.

* **Port** Port refers to the left side of the ship, when facing forward.

* **Starboard** Starboard refers to the right side of the ship, when facing forward.

If you're having trouble remembering which side is which, here's an easy trick: The words port and left both have four letters. Just know that the direction only applies when you're facing toward the bow of the ship.

## Boat Upgrades

#### Ballista
DMG
p255
Large object
Armor Class: 15
Hit Points: 50
Damage Immunities: poison, psychic
A ballista is a massive crossbow that fires heavy bolts. Before it can be fired, it must be loaded and aimed. It takes one action to load the weapon, one action to aim it, and one action to fire it.

#### Cannon (Object)
Large object
Armor Class: 19
Hit Points: 75
Damage Immunities: poison, psychic
A cannon uses gunpowder to propel heavy balls of cast iron through the air at destructive speeds. In a campaign without gunpowder, a cannon might be an arcane device built by clever gnomes or wizardly engineers.
A cannon is usually supported in a wooden frame with wheels. Before it can be fired, the cannon must be loaded and aimed. It takes one action to load the weapon, one action to aim it, and one action to fire it.

Cannon Ball. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 600/2,400 ft., one target. Hit: 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage.

#### Trebuchet
DMG
p256
Huge object
Armor Class: 15
Hit Points: 150
Damage Immunities: poison, psychic
A trebuchet is a powerful catapult that throws its payload in a high arc, so it can hit targets behind cover.
Before the trebuchet can be fired, it must be loaded and aimed. It takes two actions to load the weapon, two actions to aim it, and one action to fire it.

A trebuchet typically hurls a heavy stone. However, it can launch other kinds of projectiles, such as barrels of oil or sewage, with different effects.

Trebuchet Stone. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 300/1,200 ft. (can't hit targets within 60 feet of it), one target. Hit: 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage.

DMG

Large object

A ram consists of a movable gallery equipped with a heavy log suspended from two roof beams by chains.
The log is shod in iron and used to batter through doors and barricades.

It takes a minimum of four Medium creatures to operate a ram. Because of the gallery roof, these operators have total cover against attacks from above.

Ram. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one object. Hit: 16 (3d10) bludgeoning damage.

### Special Ship Augmentations
You may find that your ships needs further modifications.
The augmentations listed below are not possible for some
ships. Use your common sense, but as a general guide they
are not available to smaller ships (less than 50 feet in
length). It will take at least 1 week to add any of these,
perhaps longer if the materials are not readily available.

#### Additional Passenger Space / Crew Quarters: 
The ship may support 10% more passengers, but its cargo capacity is decreased by 10%.
Cost: 20% of base ship cost

#### Armor Plating: 
By attaching metal plates to the ship, the hull’s hit points are increased by +15. This modification reduces a ship’s cargo capacity by 15%. The armor plating imposes a –1 penalty on all sailing checks, and slows the ship by 1 mph.
Cost: 30% of base ship cost

#### Broad Rudder: 
A wide rudder makes a ship more nimble, granting a +1 bonus on all sailing checks.
Cost: 500 gp

#### Concealed Weapon Port: 
The ship’s belowdecks area undergoes major reconstruction in order to provide a light mounts for siege engines. A concealed weapon port can
only be recognized on a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Each concealed port reduces a ship’s cargo capacity by 5 tons, in addition to the space required by the weapon itself.
Cost: 200 gp per port (in addition to the cost of the
weapons)

#### Extended Keel: 
The ship’s keel is longer than usual for a vessel of its type. The ship’s measurements from bow to stern are 10% longer than normal, though cargo capacity is not appreciably affected. The ship is more stable, and grants a +1 bonus on all sailing checks. This improvement must be installed at the time of the ship’s construction and cannot be added later.
Cost: 10% of base ship cost

#### Figurehead: 
Some ships sport fanciful carvings on their bowsprits. This modification is strictly cosmetic, with no real impact on game play. Players are encouraged to design their own custom figureheads, such as dolphins, mermaids, and other such creatures of myth.
Cost: 100–1,000 gp, depending on the port and the craftsman

#### Increased Cargo Capacity: 
An efficient remodeling of the ship’s layout means more room for the ship’s stores. The ship’s cargo capacity is increased by 10%.
Cost: 15% of base ship cost

#### Narrow Hull: 
The ship has been intentionally designed with a more slender hull, enabling it to slip through smaller
spaces. The ship’s beam (width) is decreased by 20%, and cargo capacity is reduced by 10%. However, the ship gains a +2 bonus on all sailing checks. This improvement must be installed at the time of the ship’s construction and cannot be added later.
Cost: 15% of base ship cost

#### Ramming Prow: 
The ship bears a standard ram, usually sheathed in bronze or iron, mounted on its bow. A ship equipped with a Ramming Prow does an additional 1d4
damage to the enemy ship for every 1 mph of ship speed on a successful ram maneuver.
Cost: 1,000 gp

#### Rapid-Deploy Sails: 
The ship’s rigging undergoes a wholesale change as improvements in engineering enable the sails to be raised and lowered much faster than normal
Any sail adjustments can be made in half the normal time, granting a +1 bonus on all sailing checks.
Cost: 10% of base ship cost

#### Silk Sails: 
Few ship improvements are as beautiful as the addition of silk sails. These sails can be designed in whatever color the player desires; they are often embroidered with striking images of the sea. Such sails are usually imported from faraway lands. Silk sails give the ship superior rates of movement, as they capture and displace the wind more efficiently. A ship with silk sails gains a +1 bonus on opposed sailing checks. The ship’s tactical speed is increased by 1 mph.
Cost: 15% of base ship cost

#### Smuggling Compartments: 
The ship’s bulkheads are modified so that gaps between them can serve as hidden cargo storage areas. This does not change a ship’s cargo
capacity. A DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check is required to locate smuggling compartments in a search of the ship. A ship can be fitted with no more than four smuggling compartments.
Cost: 500 gp per 5-foot-square compartment
