# PORT BLACKSAND 

### Harbour District 
This is the oldest part of Port Blacksand. Its streets are winding and narrow, and its houses look very ancient and weather-beaten. In some streets the upper storeys overhang the road and shut out the daylight. (The district qualifies as 'Poor' when rolling on the Businesses Tables...) 

1. Lobster Wharf. The Catfish Reach is sheltered slightly from the open sea by the northern headland, making a natural harbour. There are always half a dozen or more pirate galleons and galleys at anchor here, except in the summer months, when they will be away, harassing merchant ships in more southerly waters. Trading ships also call in on their way to the open sea or upstream to Fang, Zengis and beyond. Among the most notorious ships that call here are the Black Swan, the Swordfish, the Dancing Dolphin and Lord Azzur's own magnificent Face of Chaos. At the far northern end of Lobster Wharf, where the smaller fishing boats pull in to unload their catches, there stands an immense iron anchor, said to have belonged to a trading galley from ancient Carsepolis. 

2. Fishermen's Cottages. Along the east side of the wharf runs a cluster of rickety single-story cottages, home to many of the fishermen who risk their lives on the high seas every day. On fine days, the fishwives sit outside their homes, weaving nets and repairing lobster pots. 

3. Mariners' Guild. The outside of the guild house is decorated with ivory carvings made from whales' teeth and showing various scenes of maritime adventure. The ground floor is made up of offices which handle the daily business of the guild, while the dormitory rooms on its first and second floors can sleep more than 100 sailors on shore leave. (See the section on 'People and Powers', below, for more details about the guild.) 

4. Erethrim's Candle Shop. The Elf who lives here sells candles of all shapes, sizes and colours, including some magical ones that can induce visions, knock out or hypnotize people who see them. The proprietor, Calor Erethrim, lives above the shop. 

5. Ben Borryman, Silversmith. As well as the standard range of jewellery and tableware, Borryman often un-dertakes commissions for more unusual items, and is the ideal person to make a silver sword or arrow for taking care of that difficult Werewolf! Borryman and his family (wife, two grown-up sons and one teenage daughter) live above the shop, leaving a huge hunting dog on guard in the shop at night. 

6. Eagle Tower. The ornately decorated tower which rises from the hillside to loom several decametres above the surrounding buildings is in fact the protruding top half of an even taller tower which once housed a beacon to guide mariners safely into Carsepolis harbour. It is now home to Shareela, a reclusive woman who keeps her huge collection of birds in the top levels of the tower. The eagles which give the tower its current name, and other hawks, can sometimes be seen swoop-ing around its eaves, and from time to time are rumoured to carry off small children. 

7. Eltan, Tailor. The oldest, and still the best, cloth maker and outfitter in Port Blacksand. Eltan himself has now retired to somewhere safer, and the business is run by his two sons, Oltan and Ultan. Clothes made here are very expensive, but they fit perfectly and last a lifetime. The brothers live above the shop with their wives and seven children. 

8. Jimmy Quicktint, Tattooist. The self-proclaimed 'get Tattooist in Town', Jimmy is a big, jovial ex-sailor who learned his craft in Halak while sailing with the notorious Captain Bartella. Tattoos cost 5-50 Gold Pieces, depend-ing on their complexity. Quicktint lives in a couple of rooms behind the shop. 

9. Harbour-master's Office. Port Blacksand's harbour-master, Eril Gor, is a crusty old ex-mariner, whose rolling gait is due less to his years at sea than to his wooden left leg. Gor presents himself as a scrupulously honest officer of the city, replying to any who ask, 'No amount of gold or silver can persuade me to allow goods into or out of this city without paying the proper duty.' Instead, he demands a set fee of 5 per cent of the goods themselves, which are then disposed of by Gor's many contacts round the city. 

### Inns and Taverns 

**T1.** The Mermaid Tavern. This busy alehouse's cellar hides a secret entrance to the sewers, which in turn lead down into the ruins of ancient Carsepolis. Landlord Lamy Rognar charges 20 Gold Pieces for an adventurer to set out down into the depths (and has sometimes been known to charge another zo G P to let them out again!). The tavern is of Average quality. 

**T2.** The Eye of the Needle Tavern. 

**T3.** Gashanka's Tavern. 

**T4.** Valentis' Bane Inn. A favourite with the nastier pirates. Its name refers to Lord Azzur, and his coat of arms are depicted alongside the Face of Chaos on the sign outside. (Awful quality.) 

**T5.** The Vulgar Golblin Tavern

**T6.** The Hemlock Tavern. 

**T7.** The Black Lobster Inn. Being one of the inns nearest to the harbour, it is always full of drunken pirates and other mariners celebrating a successful voyage, and clever professional gamblers and pickpockets taking their new riches from them. Adventurers and other travellers looking for passage to other lands are also regular customers. The permanently half-drunk landlord, Halron Allierte, is only a temporary manager, looking after the inn for its owner, his uncle Guidon, who also owns places in Rimon and Halak. (Poor quality.) 

**T8.** The Dagger Tavern. Apparently a quiet, orderly public house, it is in fact a front for a major smuggling operation run by the Merchants' Guild, who bring in expensive goods at night in order to avoid paying Azzur's crippling import taxes. The small front bar is the only part of the establishment where the public are allowed, a rule enforced by the immense landlord, Doric Sandwasp, and his two Troll bottle-washers. (Fair quality.)
